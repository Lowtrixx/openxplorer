//! Network sign-in: `GVfs`'s password and question prompts, answered by the
//! window's own dialog.
//!
//! Ports `MountPrompts` in `desktop/auth_bridge.py`. `OpenXplorer` owns the
//! prompt, not a credential database: `GVfs` keeps remembered passwords in
//! the keyring, and [`SessionCredentials`] keeps the account so other
//! shares on the server sign in without asking again.
//!
//! A mount gets its `gio::MountOperation` from [`MountPrompts::create`]
//! and reports the result to [`MountPrompts::finish`]. When `GVfs` asks for a
//! password, the first attempt reuses a known credential (from memory, else
//! from the keyring off the main thread); otherwise, and after a rejected
//! attempt, the window's [`SignInPrompter`] shows a [`Challenge`] and the
//! user's [`Answer`] comes back through [`MountPrompts::answer`].
//!
//! The rules of the Python module, each named where it is enforced:
//!
//! - Passwords are never passed back to the interface: a [`Challenge`]
//!   holds none, and [`Password`](super::Password) hides itself from
//!   `Debug` (SAFE-011).
//! - A rejected saved credential shows the dialog instead of looping
//!   (NET-014).
//! - Credentials are saved only after a successful mount (NET-015), and
//!   not after Sign out raced the mount (SAFE-012).
//! - An unanswered challenge expires after 180 seconds; a new challenge
//!   from the same mount replaces the old one (NET-012).
//! - Closing the window wipes its [`SessionCredentials`] from memory
//!   (SAFE-011, TAB-050).
//!
//! A successful mount of an SMB location is reported to the handlers of
//! [`MountPrompts::connect_server_mounted`], where the window resumes the
//! server's indexing, as `mount` in `desktop/winspace.py` does (NET-022).
//!
//! | Module | Responsibility |
//! |---|---|
//! | `challenge` | What the dialog shows and what the user answers |
//! | `answer` | Checking an answer against the challenge it answers |
//! | `operation` | The `gio::MountOperation` signals and replies |
//! | `password` | A known account first, else the sign-in dialog |
