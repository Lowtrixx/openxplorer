//! `__init__`, `elect`, `refresh`, `update`, `changed` and `close`
//! (SRCH-025, SRCH-027). One elected process owns the crawler and the
//! watchers for every `OpenXplorer` window; the database is shared, and
//! other processes leave their requests in it for the owner. Neither the
//! crawler nor the event handling opens file contents or mounts anything.
//!
//! Scans and updates run one at a time on a worker thread, each with its
//! own `gio::Cancellable`. The operations the app calls are in
//! `commands.rs`, the periodic work in `tick.rs`, and indexing pinned
//! folders in `pins.rs`.
