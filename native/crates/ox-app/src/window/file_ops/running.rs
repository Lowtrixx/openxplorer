//! One file operation at a time: its start, its progress in the transfer
//! panel, Cancel, and what the user is told when it ends (OPS-019,
//! OPS-022, OPS-023, OPS-024).
//!
//! Ports `runOperation`, `updateTransfer` and the `cancel` request of
//! `desktop/ui/app.js`. The operation's blocking work runs on GIO's worker
//! threads; its progress reports cross to the main loop through a
//! channel, and the panel shows them until the user cancels. When the
//! operation ends, the panel hides, the folder is listed again with the
//! items the operation created selected (the Python app cleared the
//! selection), Undo remembers how to reverse it, and a toast or the
//! "Operation result" dialog says what happened.
